the code can now determine matches, however it lists the 1st symbol in the list as the match

moving forward need to 

1. have the program determine the symbol that matches both of the cards.

2. once step 1 is complete. the next phase is setting it up like a game. only if there is time. 

    - add in more cards and symbols
    - user clicks a button when they know the answer??? 
        click any button then type in the answer, when they click any button the cards disappear to stop them from cheating. if its not right, maybe ask if its spelled           correctly? is there a way to see if the word is a close match to the answer, if it is not then they get it wrong perhaps?. play against the computer? 
        
## GAMIFYING IT IS MOST LIKELY NOT POSSIBLE WITHIN THIS TIME FRAME. JUST FOCUS ON GETTING THE TEMPLATE MATCHING SOFTWARE WORKING PROPERLY
