### 23/04/2023

the code can now determine matches, however it lists the 1st symbol in the list as the match

moving forward need to:
1. have the program determine the symbol that matches both of the cards.    
  ```diff
+ DONE
```
2. add in abit to give a visualisation of how the matching works (the grey bit with all the lines)
3. ```diff
- NEEDS COMPLETING BY THE END OF 27/04/23
```
